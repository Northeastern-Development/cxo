## What should I know before I get started?

- Make sure you have the [editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) plugin enabled or your code style will be inconsistent

## Branch/PR Overview

- The `master` branch represents the latest stable release. It consists of a set of completed features merged from `develop`.
- The `develop` branch serves as a staging area for the next release.
- All development occurs in "topic" branches. A "topic" might be a new feature or a bug fix.
- All "topic" should start with the branch name of `feature/` or `bugfix/`
  - ex: `feature/new-work-page` or `bugfix/homepage-spacing`
